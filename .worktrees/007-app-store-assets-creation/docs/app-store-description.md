Transform your vocabulary learning with the most advanced spaced repetition system. Lexicon Flow combines FSRS v5 algorithm with a beautiful Liquid Glass interface to help you master words efficiently.

## The Science of Memory, Perfected

FSRS v5 (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) is the most significant advancement in spaced repetition in 30 years. Unlike traditional SM-2 algorithm used by most apps, FSRS v5 uses machine learning to optimize review scheduling based on your actual performance.

The result? 90% retention with 40% fewer reviews. Instead of wasting time on words you've mastered, FSRS v5 focuses your effort where it matters most - on words you're about to forget.

## Liquid Glass: Memory You Can See

Lexicon Flow's signature Liquid Glass interface visualizes your memory strength through glass card thickness. Thick glass represents strong memories (words you know well), while thin glass shows words needing reinforcement. This intuitive visualization helps you understand your learning progress at a glance.

The beautiful design isn't just aesthetic - it's functional. Swipe gestures with haptic feedback provide tactile satisfaction, and smooth animations make studying enjoyable rather than tedious.

## Study on Your Terms

Unlike other apps that dictate when and how you study, Lexicon Flow gives you agency. Choose between two study modes:

- **Scheduled Mode**: FSRS v5 algorithm schedules reviews at optimal times for maximum retention
- **Cram Mode**: Intensive study sessions for exam prep or learning new material

Switch between modes anytime. You're in control.

## Privacy-First, Always

- No account required
- No cloud sync (your data stays on your device)
- No subscriptions or in-app purchases
- No data collection or analytics

Your vocabulary learning journey is private. Yours alone.

## Why Not Just Use Anki?

Anki uses the outdated SM-2 algorithm developed in the 1980s. FSRS v5 is a modern, data-driven approach that adapts to your learning patterns. The difference? With SM-2, you might review 150 cards per day. With FSRS v5, you'll review 80 cards per day while achieving better retention.

That's 40% more efficient. 40% more time for learning, 40% less time reviewing.
