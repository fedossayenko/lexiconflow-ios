## Localization Notes

### Considerations for Translation

**FSRS v5**: Keep technical name (don't translate acronym)
**Liquid Glass**: May need cultural adaptation (glass metaphor)
**90% retention**: Universal metric (translate normally)

### Character Count Expansion

When localizing, expect character expansion:
- **German**: +15-20% longer
- **French**: +10-15% longer
- **Spanish**: +5-10% longer
- **Japanese**: -10-20% shorter (kanji is compact)

**Recommendation**: Use Option 5 (127 chars) for languages that expand significantly
