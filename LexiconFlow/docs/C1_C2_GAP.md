## Technical Context

### Why C1/C2 Are Missing

The SMARTool dataset was designed for **Russian-speaking learners of English** up to B2 level. The original research focused on:

1. **Common Vocabulary**: Words most frequently used in Russian contexts
2. **Practical Communication**: Vocabulary for everyday and academic situations
3. **Resource Constraints**: Limited scope for corpus-based research

C1/C2 vocabulary requires:
- **Academic Specialization**: Field-specific terminology
- **Abstract Concepts**: Sophisticated abstract nouns and verbs
- **Low Frequency**: Rare words that require specialized corpora

### Adding C1/C2 Support

If you're interested in contributing C1/C2 vocabulary, please:

1. **Fork the repository**: [github.com/fedossayenko/lexiconflow-ios](https://github.com/fedossayenko/lexiconflow-ios)
2. **Create vocabulary JSON**: Follow the SMARTool format with C1/C2 words
3. **Include Russian translations**: Use academic register, not literal translations
4. **Submit a pull request**: We'll review and validate before inclusion
