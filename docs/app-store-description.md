## Full Description

```
LexiconFlow is the vocabulary learning app for serious learners who demand the best. We've combined the most advanced spaced repetition algorithm (FSRS v5) with a beautiful Liquid Glass interface to create the most efficient study experience available.

WHY LEXICONFLOW?

◇ FSRS v5 ALGORITHM
The next-generation spaced repetition algorithm. FSRS v5 analyzes your memory patterns to optimize review timing, achieving 90% retention rates—significantly better than traditional SM-2 algorithms used by other apps. You'll study less but remember more.

◇ BEAUTIFUL LIQUID GLASS DESIGN
Study cards with depth, blur, and beautiful gradient colors. Our Liquid Glass UI makes studying enjoyable, not a chore. The interface is both stunning and functional, with frosted glass cards and fluid animations.

◇ MULTIPLE STUDY MODES
• Flashcards: Classic spaced repetition
• Quiz: Multiple choice for quick review
• Writing: Type the answer to reinforce memory

Switch between modes based on your learning goals and time available.

◇ SMART SCHEDULING
Let the algorithm optimize your study schedule. Cards appear when you're most likely to remember them, minimizing wasted time on reviews you don't need. Study efficiently, not just more.

◇ DETAILED STATISTICS
Track your progress with retention graphs, study calendars, and performance metrics. See your learning curve improve over time with data-driven insights.

WHO IS IT FOR?

• Language learners (Spanish, Japanese, French, German, Chinese, and more)
• Test prep students (GRE, SAT, TOEFL, IELTS)
• Professionals learning industry terminology
• Anyone who wants to learn vocabulary efficiently

FSRS V5 VS TRADITIONAL ALGORITHMS

Most flashcard apps use the SM-2 algorithm from the 1980s. It's simple but outdated—it treats everyone the same and doesn't adapt to your actual memory patterns.

FSRS v5 is different:
• Machine learning based on real memory data
• Personalized to your learning patterns
• Achieves higher retention with fewer reviews
• Continuously improves as you study

The result? You remember 90% of what you learn, compared to 70-80% with older algorithms.

LIQUID GLASS UI

Traditional flashcard apps are boring. LexiconFlow makes studying beautiful.

Our Liquid Glass interface features:
• Frosted glass cards with depth blur
• Beautiful gradient colors (indigo → pink → violet)
• Fluid animations and smooth transitions
• Intuitive gesture controls
• Dark mode with adjusted glass effects

Studying should feel good. Our design makes every study session enjoyable.

STUDY MODES

FLASHCARDS
Classic spaced repetition. View the front, recall the answer, flip the card, and rate your memory. The algorithm schedules your next review based on your response.

QUIZ
Multiple choice for quick review. Ideal for fast sessions when you're short on time. Reinforce learning without the pressure of recall.

WRITING
Type the answer to strengthen memory encoding. Writing engages more cognitive processes than passive review, leading to better retention.

SMART SCHEDULING

Stop wasting time reviewing cards you already know. LexiconFlow's smart scheduling ensures you study:

• Cards you're about to forget
• New material at optimal intervals
• Difficult items more frequently

The algorithm predicts when you'll forget each card and schedules reviews just before that point. Maximum retention, minimum effort.

PRIVACY & OFFLINE

• No account required
• All data stored locally on your device
• Study offline without internet
• iCloud sync optional (encrypts your data)
• No ads, no tracking, no data selling

YOUR DATA BELONGS TO YOU.
