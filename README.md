# Lexicon Flow iOS

> **The Next-Generation Vocabulary App for iOS 26.2**

---

## Project Identity

**Name:** Lexicon Flow

**Mission:** Eliminate friction from language learning by combining advanced Spaced Repetition, on-device AI, and iOS 26's "Liquid Glass" design to create a state of flow in vocabulary acquisition.

**Status:** 📋 Planning / Architecture Phase

**Target Launch:** Q2 2026 (June)

---

## Executive Summary

Lexicon Flow is a native iOS application for English vocabulary acquisition using the **Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS v5)** algorithm. Built with **Swift 6**, **SwiftUI**, **SwiftData**, and **iOS 26** frameworks, Lexicon Flow represents a paradigm shift from static, interval-gated learning to dynamic, AI-enriched, and fluidly designed experiences.

## Data Model

```
Deck (1) ────< (N) Card (1) ────< (N) ReviewLog
     │                │
     │                └─── (1) FSRSState
     │
     └─── iconData (@Attribute(.externalStorage))
```

### Core Entities

- **Deck**: Container for cards with name, icon, order
- **Card**: Word with definition, phonetic, image, generated sentence
- **FSRSState**: Stability, difficulty, retrievability, due date, state
- **ReviewLog**: Historical analytics for FSRS optimization

---

## Algorithm: FSRS v5

### Why FSRS Instead of SM-2?

**SM-2 Limitations:**
- Static multipliers don't adapt to individual learning patterns
- Single difficulty metric can't distinguish "hard to learn" from "fast to forget"
- Late reviews don't increase stability appropriately
- No explicit modeling of memory decay

**FSRS Advantages:**
- Three-component model (S, D, R) captures memory dynamics
- Adapts to individual forgetting curves
- Handles late and early reviews gracefully
- Optimizes based on user's actual review history

### The Mathematical Model

```
R(t) = (1 + factor × t/S)^decay
```

Where:
- **R(t)** = Probability of recall at time t
- **S** = Stability (time for R to drop from 100% to 90%)
- **D** = Difficulty (intrinsic complexity, 0-10)

### Implementation

Lexicon Flow uses the open-source **SwiftFSRS** package:

```swift
import SwiftFSRS

let scheduler = FSRS()  // v5 parameters
let result = scheduler.review(card: card, rating: .good)
// Returns: new due date, stability, difficulty, retrievability
```

---

## "Liquid Glass" Design System

### Visual Philosophy

iOS 26 introduces "Liquid Glass"—a dynamic material that blurs, refracts, and morphs in response to interaction. Lexicon Flow uses this to visualize memory:

- **Fragile memory** (low stability): Thin, transparent glass
- **Stable memory** (high stability): Thick, frosted glass

### Technical Implementation

```swift
GlassEffectContainer(spacing: 20) {
    ForEach(cards) { card in
        FlashcardView(card: card)
            .glassEffect(.regular, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16))
            .interactive($offset) { dragOffset in
                // Reactive refraction based on swipe direction
            }
    }
}
```

### Morphing Transitions

Instead of standard 3D flip, cards use `glassEffectTransition(.materialize)`:

- Front content blurs into glass
- Back content sharpens from refraction
- `matchedGeometryEffect` for smooth element transitions

## Monetization Strategy

### Freemium Model

| Feature | Free Tier | Pro Tier |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **FSRS Algorithm** | Full (never crippled) | Full |
| **New Words/Day** | 20 | Unlimited |
| **AI Sentences** | Limited | Unlimited |
| **TTS Accents** | Basic | All 4 (Neural quality) |
| **Cloud Sync** | — | Multi-device via CloudKit |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Basic view | Full visualization |
| **Price** | $0 | $6.99/mo or $39.99/yr |

**Philosophy:** Users pay for *more of what works*, not for *basic functionality*.
